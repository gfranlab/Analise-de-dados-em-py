Hi Development!

This analysis was conducted to study an e-commerce business with a focus on general clothing sales.

The PyCharm IDE and Python were utilized to perform data cleaning, maintenance, distribution, and metrics. Furthermore, dynamic charts were created using the 'Pandas', 'Plotly', and 'Dash' libraries in Python.

Please contact me with any suggestions, as I am open to discussing further ideas and insights regarding the data.
